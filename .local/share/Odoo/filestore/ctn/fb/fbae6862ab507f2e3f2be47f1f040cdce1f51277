Hi Alex, Miller and Flanzie,

Me being a smartphone novice I'm looking to figure out what the options
are for developing this 88 location bus tour for black history month, sat
feb 7.

Alex thank you for responding and noting that open street maps would be a
good place to start. so I found my way to:
http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Software/Mobile

i clicked on the android, went through the list and came up with a few
that i need your input to help identify then qualify for this project.
Naturally, those of you that have apple, windows and or blackberry devices
that you can share please feel free to explore them.
software is listed by name in the first column along site other columns
that are:
Screenshot 	Display map 	Navigate 	Make track 	Monitor 	License 	Price
	Languages 	Version 	Description
i've gone through the list and pulled out the following which mostly show
green colors in the above columns including version....

now i do not expect you to go through each of them but maybe Alex can
start at the top of the list and go down, Miller can start somewhere in
the middle and go a little up then a little down and Flanzie start at the
bottom of the list and work her way up we can cover the list together.

Candy and I will spend time going through the list, just in case.

if you see any you like. please download it to see if you still like it
once it's on your device.  cheers!

OSMTracker stands for OpenStreetMap Tracker. It allows you to track your
journey and mark significant way points. Way points can be marked with a
tag using a button, with a quick voice record, a text note or by taking a
picture. The various button pages and layouts can be customized to suit
your OpenStreetMap activities. You can view your current track on top of
an OpenStreetMap background.
