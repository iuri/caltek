hi jill,

i read this last night and i'm so glad to encounter you and online
learning pipe-line.

i have just spent 15min putting what you sent me into the
http://exelearning.net
attached .elp file. see if you can install it on your computer and open it.
i also attached a .zip file that when unzipped will created an html5 self
contained version of what is in the .elp file

much more to come. please sign-up @ http://caltek.net  first click on sign
in and then sign up.

cheers!

Hi Ken,

It was great chatting with you yesterday.  You restored my faith I can do
this!  I'm sending you a draft copy of the *Mass Defense System Design
Project *assignment based on our conversation yesterday. If you don't mind
reviewing the draft assignment for clarity and conciseness. Did I miss any
steps, are terms / concepts clearly defined and make sense.   It's
important I provide an overview of the project for the students. Next,
describe the necessary steps for them to complete the tasks at hand e.g.,
in consultation with a programmer, guide the design, development, and
launch of a mass defense system model. I also wrote up the organization
matching scenario exercise.

I also visited the Virtual World Sandbox site. It's great, I want to learn
how to use the virtual simulation program.  Can video & photos be
converted
into a virtual simulation format?  If so, I have footage of the NYPD
police
bike squad <https://twitter.com/ashagony/status/859172604015411201> I'd
like to convert.  If not, how are the assets created e.g., bicycles, etc.?

Thank you,
Jill

*Mass Defense Systems Design Final Project*





*Overview*

The *Designing Mass Defense Systems Final Project* objectives is to teach
students the skills of research, design, development, and implementation
of
community based mass defense systems (MDS) also called legal
infrastructure
(LI).  Students will be assigned to 1 of 3 project teams. Each team is
responsible for researching and writing-up the results of their case
study.  Each case is based on one of 3-types of mass defense systems:
community based governed, legal association, and legal collective.



*Instructions*

Students are assigned to 1 of 3 project teams: a community based governed,
legal association, and legal collective.  Each project team is given the
core elements (otherwise called pillars) of a mass defense system: legal
representation, legal observation, and jail support.  Additionally, each
team is responsible for identifying the core elements of their
organizational mass defense system, requirements, and features (The
specific features of each MDS will also be given to each team.) In the
context of this project, I define features as specific design elements of
the MDS’ core pillars.  The core elements can be classified as either
‘basic’ / ‘necessary’ or ‘ancillary’ / ‘not necessary’: one such example
is
providing legal representation as a necessary feature while police
negotiators and / or de-escalators illustrate ancillary features- not
necessary.



*Pairing Project Teams with Programmers (Database Schema)*

In Part II of the project, each project team is given the schema for each
of the 3 pillar databases: legal representation, legal observation, and
jail support.  Project teams can also add their own features
(requirements)
to the mass defense system, describing how it fits within the pillar, and
to build a case for its use and implementation of the feature.



Second, project teams will be assigned to a programmer from
VolunteerMatch.org, to guide the design process.  The programmers are
responsible for providing technical support to each project team in the
design, development, and implementation of the mass defense systems. In
consultation with Global Business Inc. and Kent… the instructor will
identify the learning management ecosystem (platform) and programing tools
to build and house the project team’s MDS.  Using this approach allows for
a continual improvement and continuity process.



*Case Report Write-up (Product)*

Finally, each team is responsible for submitting a case report of their
organization.  Project teams will research, interview key respondents, and
write-up a case report of their findings that will be presented to the 3
organizations.



*ASSIGNMENTS*

*Organization and Scenario Matching Exercise*

Project teams will be provided with descriptive data of each organization
and scenarios for the *Organization and Scenario Matching Exercise*.
Next,
project teams will identify possible scenarios that match with either of
the 3 organizations. Each project team will write-up a two-page brief
explaining the criteria they used in their decision-making process to
identify and select the organizations for each scenario.



*Project Tools*

Design conceptual templates for students



*Sources*

Include at least ten academic sources as well as videos, and or audio
sources to develop your proposal.  Be creative and integrate photos,
audio,
and other new media resources to make this an interesting project.  Use
Purdue
Modern Language Association (MLA) Formatting and Style Guide
<https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/01/>.  If you are not
familiar with MLA citation format and or need guidance please feel free to
send me an email for guidance or just Google MLA format.

*VolunteerMatch.Org Programmer Request Ad*



I am a distance learning instructor with the University of Toledo who is
teaching an undergraduate course on the nuts-and-bolts of building mass
defense systems, commonly known as legal infrastructure.  I am looking for
3 to 4 programmers who are interested in working with my undergraduate
students on their course projects to design, develop, and implement mass
defense system models.  Programmers would be responsible for writing a
program to run the remote database system.  This is a great learning
opportunity to gain experience collaborating with young minds on a dynamic
project!  The duration of the project is for 1 semester beginning January
22 – April 30, 2018 with a moderate to minimum workload. If you are
interested in working on the project I can be contacted via email at:
jhumphries2012@gmail.com.  Regards, Dr. Jill M. Humphries
