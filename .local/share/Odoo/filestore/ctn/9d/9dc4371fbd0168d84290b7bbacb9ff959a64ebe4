Dear Alvin Khoo

Your Comments: A little of myself. I used to work as an IT professional
for over 10 years, I left my job 2 months ago, to take a short career
break and focus on what I love doing.

Which of the following, do you have experience, resources and or an
interest in, if any?

OS-
Debian
Ubuntu
CentOS
OpenSUSE
ArchLinux

The Computer Refurbishing Tech is a Teknowledgy Pass Thru System comprised
of using Linux Desktop and Server spins on donated hardware.

So, to start with I need you to get 2 or more computers that you can
connect and turn on so I can guide you through the basics of knowing how
to test and ultimately install new software on donated hardware.

There's a start up toolkit for this that i helped develop over 20yrs ago.
The objective is to use discarded hardware as an asset for developing
options for the utilization of ICT information communications technology
as a means of resources supporting civic engagements among other
empowerments.

so while you are identifying, hardware. it would be most appreciated if
you would sign-in and then sign-up on http://caltek.net which is an
instance of http://openeducat.org that i installed on my newly acquired
http://cloudatcost.com developer 4 account.

also feel free to suggest what you'd really like to be doing with this.
i'm flexible.

cheers!
