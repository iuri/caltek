I will tell you about my own mother. After my dad was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkins lymphoma he started using the Budwig protocol and in sympathy, my mom started doing the protocol with my dad.
\par She had bursitis in her hip and very stiff swollen finger joints. She has been battling with arthritis for more than 15 years prior to starting the
\par Budwig protocol. In fact the pain in her hip was so severe that she could not climb stairs. She is 68 and my dad is 71. After 3 months on the protocol her hip has totally r
ecovered and she now literally runs up and down stairs. She also has full movement in all her fingers and totally and completely stopped using all the pain killers. After some research I discovered that certain foods should be avoided namely nightshade fa
m
ily vegetables such as tomatoes, potatoes, eggplants and peppers. We included MSM, ginger (fresh) and bromelain, either in capsule form or simply by eating pineapple. Also, prior to the Budwig protocol she hardly ever sat in the sun because of her very se
nsitive skin. Now, breakfast and sometimes lunch is served outside on the patio, 'Al Fresco', and both my parents get at least 20 minutes of sun every day.
\par The improvement is remarkable and my mom cannot stop talking about how wonderful she feels. If you ne
ed more info or if you would like to write to my mom you can contact me and I'm sure she'll be more than happy to tell you about her dramatic improvement herself.

I was diagnosed last October (2003) with advanced prostate cancer, the most aggressive type with lymph node involvement. I started soon afterward on flax}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab0\af38 \ltrch\fcs0 \b0\lang2057\langfe1031\cgrid0\langnp2057\insrsid16088858  }{

f turmeric and ginger to the mix. When all this started I was having severe arthritic pain in my arms and shoulders. If I got my arm up behind my head at night I could not get it down without reaching up with my other arm and pulling it down. Any kind of 
p
hysical labor caused my whole body to ache. If I had to reach across the car and unlock the door for my wife my arm in the biceps area would hurt so bad I would get tears in my eyes. Soon after starting flaxseed oil/cottage cheese I was splitting wood and
 
after about 2 hours it dawned on me that I was not hurting. I thought it would start when I went into the house. It never did start and I am totally free of the pain. I also have had a dramatic improvement in my hypertension. That is my experience with fl
axseed oil/cottage cheese. My PSA is down from 358 to 4.7 some of that is due to hormone therapy}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab0\af38 \ltrch\fcs0 \b0\lang2057\langfe1031\cgrid0\langnp2057\insrsid1400155  [which Dr. Budwig advises against]}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab0\af38

h
e growth three times a day. I also rubbed flaxseed oil into my hands daily. Slowly and gradually the growth diminished in size so that by the time the path lab report was received, the growth had disappeared. The dermatologist was delighted with me that t

\par On February 10th 2002 I brought my husband to the emergency room with a splitting headache and projectile vomit
ing. We thought it was a bad migraine but later found out that it was a brain tumor. On February 12th he had surgery and the surgeon told us and the lab work later confirmed that he had a Glioblastoma Multiforme IV. It is the most deadly and fast moving b
rain tumor you can have. The surgeon removed all of the tumor he could see. The doctor told our family that Tom had about 26 weeks to live if he didn\lquote 
t take any radiation and if he did take radiation it might give him a year. Tom was in the hospital for eight days. We were not sure what to do so we took the doctor\lquote 
s referral and went to radiation about a week after he got out of the hospital. Tom only took five days of radiation and it made him feel terrible, and sapped all of his energy.
\par We are Christians and knew that we needed to seek the Lord\rquote 
s guidance in this crisis. So we went to our Church and had Tom anointed with oil and hands laid on in prayer by the elders of the Church (James 5:14). After that some friends came forward and told us of some alterna
tive ways people were fighting and winning the battle against cancer. Since the doctors did not hold out any hope we decided to throw our lot in with the holistic treatments and did not take anymore radiation. We started the holistic regimen in March.

\par Tom\lquote 
s three month MRI looked good, his brain was clean and the hole where they removed the tumor was empty except for a tiny line around a portion of the inside of the hole. The doctor said that it could be scar tissue, a benign bit of tumor or a regrowth of 
the Glioblastoma.
\par At the six month MRI his brain was completely clean. There was no cancer at all. The doctor said that it was a miracle. In 14 years of practice he had not seen anything like it.
\par This is what we did:
\par Take 1/4 cup Low Fat Cottage Cheese and mix it with 1 tablespoon Flaxseed oil and eat it twice a day.
\par Take Three 750 mg Shark Cartilage capsules three times a day
\par Take a Borage Oil and CoQ10 supplement
\par Drink plenty of water
\par Try to get light exercise like walking
\par Get some sunlight
\par I also eat flaxoil/cottage cheese twice a day with my husband. I'm trying to get my kids to eat it too.
\par Tom walks at least 4 miles a day now and has started lifting weights too.
\par We are having good results with the flax oil/cottage cheese, and will keep it up for the rest of our lives.

\par Hello Elena, 
\par I feel real good about my case and will very soon have tests done that should give a definitive answer to how I am doing. I was diagnosed on Oct. 8, 2002 with a large breast cancer - "lobular infiltrating carcinoma". 
\par I began that same day on flax}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f38\fs24\lang2057\langfe1031\langnp2057\insrsid10121106  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f38\fs24\lang2057\langfe1031\langnp2057\insrsid5134618\charrsid5388876

\par By the middle of November my pain was all gone and I have remained painfree.

\par With the P.E.T. scan, they injected into my veins sugar and radio-active isotopes.
\par The sugar goes to all spots in my body where there is any cancer, and will even show how large it is. And it can be tracked by the radio active isotopes.
\par I can still feel a small ridge and I have wondered if that is scar tissue (since it has been so long since I have felt any pain).

, as my husband had a very large, and metastasized pancreatic cancer, in 1994.
\par He took many things in the alternative field, but NOTHING IN the medical field, (unless you want to consider his 3 weeks of IV treatments of Laetrile)
\par He also took flax}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f38\fs24\lang2057\langfe1031\langnp2057\insrsid1734096  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f38\fs24\lang2057\langfe1031\langnp2057\insrsid5134618\charrsid5388876 oil/cottage cheese 3 times a day.

\par To his surgeon's astonishment, he was well in 5 months after surgery. The surgeon had told us that he would die and that he might live 3 to 6 months - 3 being most likely.
\par He had gotten ill at the end of December, 1993 and was in 
and out of the hospital until May 25, he had exploratory surgery and got the grim reports I reports above. But after we got home and got him on the juicing, he just began getting better. I was making fresh vegetable juice and giving him 12 ounces about ev
ery 2 hours.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f38\fs24\lang2057\langfe1031\langnp2057\insrsid1734096  And we followed the diet scrupul}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f38\fs24\lang2057\langfe1031\langnp2057\insrsid5134618\charrsid5388876 
ously - no meat, absolutely no pork, no sugar, no processed foods of any kind, etc. etc. and he just kept getting better.
\par Finally in November 1994, I wrote to the surgeon and ask him if he would schedule a CT scan for when we had an appointment on December 5, 1994.
\par He did that and when he came to give us the report, he was just shaking his head. He said "I don't know what to tell you folks, but there is no cancer in there. I even had the radiologist come back and 
study that with me and we can see nothing abnormal in there of any kind."
\par So with that kind of encouragement, I felt confident to do basically the same thing. Except that in the meantime, I have learned a lot more about FC/cottage cheese and so I am going mostly all the way with that.
\par I guess you could say I have put all my eggs in that one basket.
\par I know this is a long message and I am sorry. I hope it helps your mother. 
\par My husband was 54 the year he got sick. He is still well and still with me today.

\par OUR CANCER STORIES - as of March 27, 2004 
\par Our background history: Both of my husband's parents died of cancer. His mother had breast cancer and his Dad had brain cancer. One of them had radiation treatments a
nd the other had chemo. We saw their quality of life go downhill from then on, for aboout a year and they died. We said "if we ever get cancer, we are not going to take either one of those treatments." Maybe the treatments have improved over the years, bu
t my mind has not changed. I refuse to let anything into my body that will harm it. I will only take something that will do something to build my body up and strengthen my immune system. 
\par Then in 1994 Huck was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and given poss
ibly 3 months to live. We were fortunate to have an honest doctor who told us that it would serve no purpose for him to take radiation or chemo, because they cannot do any good, when cancer is in the pancreas. It was not hard to convince him, as that was 
already our decision, from years back. 
\par We treated him from home, with alternative methods (before that time we knew nothing of any such treatments). We tried everything we heard of or could read about. Basically it was ALL DIETARY. We worked with a Doctor 
of Nutrition, who practices in Illinois. One thing he told us was to go to a health food store and buy Flax Seed Oil, that was being stored in a refrigerator. And to get some low fat cottage cheese. To mix these two together and eat a small amount 3 times
 
a day. We had never heard of Flax Seed Oil, but we did as he said. Plus we did so many other things, including Huck taking many vitamins and going on a very restricted diet of only vegetables, beans, and grains. Within 6 months Huck had recovered from tha
t
 "very large tumor". We asked the same surgeon to take a CAT scan and tell us what it looked like. His report? : He was astounded when he told us that there was no sign of cancer, that everything looked completely normal. Huck has remained free of cancer 
ever since then - 1994. 
\par Then on October 8, 2002 I was awakened with serious pain in one breast. My hand went to that area and felt a large protrusion. I called, that day, for an appointment with my doctor. All tests were conducted and I was diagnosed with 
Lobular Infiltrating Carcinoma. I went that very day to the health food store and bought Flax Seed Oil and to the grocery for low fat cottage cheese. I have not missed a day of eating it since then. And I have learned a whole lot more about that cancer pr
otocol, discovered by Dr. Johanna Budwig in the 1950s. The chemical composition of the mixture gives 
\par you Omega III, which almost everyone is deficient of. By the end of two weeks, after I had begun taking this mixture, my pain subsided. I have had some pai
ns VERY occasionally since then, but nothing lasting or severe. My energy has remained high and I have continued with my previous life style. I have not had one day of any kind of ill effects, or of even feeling tired. 
\par In September 2003, my doctor order a
 P.E.T. scan and a CAT scan to be done. These showed that I had no cancer cells in my body except at the original site. And that the tumor had shrunk from 6 centimeters in the beginning to 1.3 centimeters. These are very expensive tests and Medicare }{

ot pay for them if they are done more often than once a year, unless the patient is taking traditional AMA medicine (chemo or radiation). So I plan to have the tests repeated in September or October of 2004. I expect it to find no cancer cells anywhere in
 my body, by then.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f38\fs24\cgrid0\insrsid5134618

\par She had also been put on chemo with a port installed. This was causing her problems.
\par Then she remembered the Flaxseed Oil process and decided to go that route. She put the flaxseed oil, cottage cheese and all kinds of good stuff in a blender and mixed it all at once.
\par Things didn't seem to be doing a lot of good. Finally we realized that she wasn't mixing the cottage cheese and the flaxseed oil together first. It was being diluted with all the other stuff.
\par There is a lot of belief that the protein isn't necessary, but Dr. Budwig says very much otherwise. If there is only a tablespoon of Flax oil,
 there may be enough protein in what we eat to do the job. I read that the Flax Oil should be used at meals because the protein made it more effective.
\par I have read some scientists saying the protein isn't necessary but I question whether they are talking about more than a }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f38\fs24\lang2057\langfe1031\langnp2057\insrsid1734096\charrsid5388876 tablespoonful}{

\par If there is a larger amount of oil, I believe it is necessary to have the protein mixed with it first, either with cottage cheese or yogurt. If yogurt is used it needs to be three times as much as cottage cheese because the protein is only a third.

\par Now Emilie changed her approach. She blends the flaxseed oil and cottage cheese together first, and then adds the other goodies.
\par The Oncologist gave her a very hard time over her refusal to take more chemo.
\par Her daughter, an RN, urged her to take more chemo. She refused. She began feeling much better soon.

 remarkable recovery". The surgery that was initially postponed till after the chemo was no longer necessary as there was no tumor left. Today, February 11 2004, my dad went back for follow-up tests. All and everything is still within normal range and he 
is still feeling very healthy. We are so grateful and thankful and I will keep you people updated.

\par He took many things in the alternative field, but NOTHING IN the medical field, (unless you want to consider his 3 weeks of IV treatments of Laetrile)
\par He also took flaxoil/cottage cheese 3 times a day. 
\par To his surgeon's astonishment, he was well in 5 months after surgery. 
\par The surgeon had told us that he would die and that he might live 3 to 6 months - 3 being most likely. 
\par He had gotten ill at the end of December, 1993 and was in and out of the
\par Hospital until May 25, he had exploratory surgery and got the grim reports I reports above. 
\par But after we got home and got him on the juicing, he just began getting

\par hours.

ously - no meat, absolutely no pork, no sugar, no processed foods of any kind, etc. etc. and he just kept getting better. 
\par Finally in November 1994, I wrote to the surgeon and ask him if he w
ould schedule a CT scan for when we had an appointment on December 5, 1994. He did that and when he came to give us the report, he was just shaking his head. He said "I don't know what to tell you folks, but there is no cancer in there. I even had the rad
iologist come back and study that with me and we can see nothing abnormal in there of any kind. "
\par So with that kind of encouragement, I felt confident to do basically the same thing. Except that in the meantime, I have learned a lot more about }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f38\fs24\cgrid0\insrsid5134618 flaxseed }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24

\par Hello, 
\par I thought I would add my story to the others you have collected. 
\par My husband had pancreatic cancer in 1994 which was discovered during surgery. It was larger than they had thought from looking at his first C. A. T. Scan, and it had spread all around. Was grown around two of the body's main blood carrying vessels
 and was almost over to the liver. They removed nothing but took fine needle aspirations. The lab report on it came back as being Adenoma Carcinoma. They gave him possibly 3 months to live. When we got home, we treated him with everything in the alternati
v
e field that we could hear or learn about. One of these items was 1 Tablespoon low fat cottage cheese mixed with 1 Tablespoon Flax Seed oil, 3 times a day. He gradually got better, put back on 25 pounds and was feeling good, and so 5 months after the surg
ery, I requested another C. A. T. Scan. It showed that there was no cancer anywhere. The doctors were amazed and didn't know}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f38\fs24\insrsid1734096  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f38\fs24\insrsid5134618 
what to make of it. 
\par Since we had used so many methods of Alternative, we didn't give the Flax Seed Oil all of the credit - we didn'
t know what had brought about the "all clear". But after reading your testimonies on the Internet, I have recently begun on it myself, having recently been diagnosed with breast cancer. Now I am filled with hope.

\par You are welcome to use this information any way you want. This story has been published in a widely read newsletter put out by The Health Resource in Conway, Arkansas.

 and they notified my husband and asked him to speak at their annual meeting. He declined as he does not see himself as a public speaker. 
\par We have copies of he letters from the surgeon [Dr. Russell Postier] in Oklahoma City [affiliated with Oklahoma University Medical Center] to our local surgeon [Dr. Tim Gilbert] who referred us to Dr. Postier. 
\par In his lab reports, Dr. Postier reported the type of cancer and gave his prognosis for my husband. 
\par In spite of these reports we know that Dr. Gilbert absolutely refused to believe that my husband had ever had cancer when he was the one who had been searching for the reasons he had been so ill for five months, had him in the hospital here in Ponca C
ity, Oklahoma for a week running tests and then finally sent us to Dr. Postier. 
\par We do know that doctors do refuse to believe anything good can come out of the Alternative field. 
\par Since that report was published we have sent out hundreds of copies of it to people all over the nation.

\par OUR CANCER STORIES - as of March 27, 2004 
\par Our background history: Both of my husband's parents died of cancer. His mother had breast cancer and his Dad had brain
 cancer. One of them had radiation treatments and the other had chemo. We saw their quality of life go downhill from then on, for about a year and they died. We said "if we ever get cancer, we are not going to take either one of those treatments." Maybe t
he treatments have improved over the years, but my mind has not changed. I refuse to let anything into my body that will harm it. I will only take something that will do something to build my body up and strengthen my immune system. 
\par Then in 1994 Huck was d
iagnosed with pancreatic cancer and given possibly 3 months to live. We were fortunate to have an honest doctor who told us that it would serve no purpose for him to take radiation or chemo, because they cannot do any good, when cancer is in the pancreas.
 It was not hard to convince him, as that was already our decision, from years back. 
\par We treated him from home, with alternative methods (before that time we knew nothing of any such treatments). We tried everything we heard of or could read about. Basicall
y it was ALL DIETARY. We worked with a Doctor of Nutrition, who practices in Illinois. One thing he told us was to go to a health food store and buy Flax Seed Oil, that was being stored in a refrigerator. And to get some low fat cottage cheese. To mix the
s
e two together and eat a small amount 3 times a day. We had never heard of Flax Seed Oil, but we did as he said. Plus we did so many other things, including Huck taking many vitamins and going on a very restricted diet of only vegetables, beans, and grain
s
. Within 6 months Huck had recovered from that "very large tumor". We asked the same surgeon to take a CAT scan and tell us what it looked like. His report? : He was astounded when he told us that there was no sign of cancer, that everything looked comple
tely normal. Huck has remained free of cancer ever since then - 1994. 
\par Then on October 8, 2002 I was awakened with serious pain in one breast. My hand went to that area and felt a large protrusion. I called, that day, for an appointment with my doctor. All 
tests were conducted and I was diagnosed with Lobular Infiltrating Carcinoma. I went that very day to the health food store and bought Flax Seed Oil and to the grocery for low fat cottage cheese. I have not missed a day of eating it since then. And I have
 
learned a whole lot more about that cancer protocol, discovered by Dr. Johanna Budwig in the 1950s. The chemical composition of the mixture gives you Omega III, which almost everyone is deficient of. By the end of two weeks, after I had begun taking this 
m
ixture, my pain subsided. I have had some pains VERY occasionally since then, but nothing lasting or severe. My energy has remained high and I have continued with my previous life style. I have not had one day of any kind of ill effects, or of even feelin
g tired. 
\par In September 2003, my doctor order}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f38\fs24\insrsid1734096 ed}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f38\fs24\insrsid5134618 
 a P.E.T. scan and a CAT scan to be done. These showed that I had no cancer cells in my body except at the original site. And that the tumor had shrunk from 6 centimeters in the beginning to 1.3 centimeters. These are very expensive tests and Medicare }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f38\fs24\insrsid9517676 will}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f38\fs24\insrsid5134618 
 not pay for them if they are done more often than once a year, unless the patient is taking traditional AMA medicine (chemo or radiation). So I plan to have the tests repeated in September or October of 2004. I
 expect it to find no cancer cells anywhere in my body, by then.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f38\fs24\cgrid0\insrsid5134618

\f38\fs24\insrsid5134618 Hi Kay:
\par I'm not as knowledgeable as many others on this site, but I do believe from reading and talking to others, and personal experience, that the flaxoil/cottage cheese does work. My Dad found out he had pancreatic cancer in January. 
\par We used the flaxoil/cottage cheese, along with some other things, and it was gone by June. 
\par Unfortunately, his heart gave out two weeks ago and he died. But it wasn't from the cancer. 
\par I've become a believer in this, I take it once a day as a preventive, as I had cancer in 1995. I didn't know about this then, and fortunately surgery was able to take care of my cancer at that time. 
\par I recommend you read as much as you can, get Dr. Budwig's books (they are on Amazon), and talk to more than one doctor about traditional care. I found with my Dad that there can be big differences in traditional care from one doctor to the next. 
\par And look through the archives on this site, and contact women who have had breast cancer. 
\par My prayers go with you and your Mom.

\par In early 1994 a young man 24 had a siezure at work and an MRI found he
 had a brain tumor. There was an operation at a major cancer center in The Southeast and a major part of it was removed but it could not all be excised and he was told that further effective treatment would not be possible. He might make it from two to fo
ur months. 
\par About that time a friend gave him a tape and he began using flaxseed oil and cottage cheese. Three months later he went back to the cancer center and there was no change. Three months later he went back for another checkup and the doctor told hi
m, "I have no explanation for this but there is not further cause for concern. "
\par I knew about this because by this time his mother called me and told me. I heard no more for some time and then heard that the young man was in trouble again. He had figured that all was well and quit using the oil. 
\par Again he used it and in a few weeks was doing well again. The next time I heard from them he had gone back to the center and phoned his mother that what was left of the tumor had shrunk in half. Now, for the first 
time he asked the doctor what he thought of using flaxseed oil. The Doctor said, "If you are using flaxseed oil, keep it up. I use it every day". This man is one of the top neurosurgeons in The Southeast. Then I heard from his mother that He had gone down
 
for a check up and came home without waiting for the results. At the time she talked to me she felt very optimistic when the report came from the doctor. I know now that he had a grade 4 Astrocytoma which is usually fatal in six months to a year from its 
inception. On October 19, 1999 I met a man who knew him and he told me Mitch was not doing well. He passed away a short time later. He used the flax oil to the end. 
\par Dr. Basile knew him well and told he that in part his death at that time came from complica
tions from the chemo and steroids that he was still getting. The upside is that he had at least four years of good quality life added as a result of the use of Flaxseed Oil. 
\par My Oncologist told me that no doctor believes that cancer is ever cured, but that all they can do is try to keep ahead of it as long as possible. Compared to normal expectations Mitch did well.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0

 I understand that there have been two operations which have left her somewhat impaired and the doctors are still giving her chemo. She is using flax oil and that appears to be causing her to survive or so her friends believe. No one can ever know what wo
u
ld have happened had she been put on heavy use of flax oil and not had the other treatments that have been damaging because no one can ever try it both ways. Her folks strongly opposed the use of Flaxseed Oil and herbs but finally relented somewhat and al
lowed it to be used along with the chemo and now, in December of 1999 are praising chemo for what it has done for their daughter. 
\par She got weaker and weaker. The Family kept giving her the flaxoil/cottage cheese and the doctors kept pushing the chemo until the very last. She finally passed away in May of 2003 having gotten to the point where she was unaware of anything around her. 

\par She lived much longer, and quite a little of it worthwhile, than was originally expected.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\f38\fs24\insrsid5134618

\par Hello Mr. Beckwith:
\par 
\par I gave a copy of your testimony to a lady who had one breast removed and was given a grim diagnosis that the cancer had spread and that within a year she would likely be back to remove the other one. She had received all the chemo and radiation she could 
take. The surgeon basically sent her home because there was nothing else they could do. She told me that she had no energy and that she had to give up all her activities. She believed that there was no hope and that it was just a matter of time. 
\par She starte
d the flax oil. For the first few days she felt more tired than ever. The fourth day she began to feel a surge of energy. She continued to feel stronger and stronger. Within a couple of weeks she felt so good that she re-joined all the clubs and activitie
s that she had to abandon before. She went on a trip to Eastern Canada that involved a lot of walking and said that she had no problems at all. 
\par Two weeks ago she had an appointment with the surgeon and found that the other breast was fine and that she had no sign of problems. He told her to come back in a year for another check-up. 
\par She phoned me yesterday to thank me again for the info that gave her life back. According to her, she was already taking vitamin supplements and good eating habits but it was th
e flax oil that made this miraculous difference. She said that she would continue to take the 5 tablespoons of flax oil in yogurt.

biopsy in a couple of weeks and she immediately began using flaxseed oil and cottage cheese at the rate of three tablespoons a day. 
\par When the biopsy was done a malignancy was found. Other tests were done and a mastectomy was recommended. At this point she 
would have gone strictly with the flaxseed oil, but Tenncare would pay the $3000. 00 for the tests only if she did what was recommended. The operation was set up but was postponed six weeks to try to get a surgeon to do reconstructive surgery at the same 
time. 
\par It couldn't be worked out so finally, it was felt that she should have the procedure before any spread occurred. The operation was performed and the removed tissue sent to the lab for analysis.
\par There were no cancer cells detectable. She said the only
 good thing about it was that she had told the surgeon what she was doing and he suddenly got very interested because his wife had advanced breast cancer, had had a double mastectomy and was not doing well at all. He had had her flown to clinics wherever 
there seemed to be any hope and it hadn't helped.

angry that the original doctor had passed it off and wasted a month. She was now using the flaxseed oil and cottage cheese at six tablespoons a day. 
\par When she had a checkup preparatory to the stem cell transplant the cancer had already disappeared. The doc

\par To All, 
\par Well, I have told you I would give this report, but have had the most exasperating WAITING experience, getting the full report from the Radiologist. But I got it this evening. 
\par So now I will begin at the beginning. 
\par When this lump came up in my breast, on Oct. 8, 2002, I went to the doctor. He looked at it and said "Boy, that is a big one!" He sent me to the hospital for an }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f38\fs24\insrsid3294334 Ultrasound}{\rtlch\fcs1 
\af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f38\fs24\insrsid5134618 . And then a biopsy. (I can't believe that I let them do that biopsy, but I think I was in shock). Any way, from that biopsy, I learned that I had "lobular, infiltrating }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24

 I went back to the doctor, he said "well it is malignant, so the first step will be a double mastectomy, followed by chemo". I said "wait, wait! No, I don't plan to do those things. My husband had pancreatic cancer in 
1994, and we used alternative treatments and he recovered. I have written up a copy of his story, from my journal, and I have brought you a copy of it. I plan to do the same thing that my husband did, but I }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0

" From that day forward he would never return a call from me. I tried to call him for about 2 weeks. I presume, when he read that report and saw that it was all a
lternative things that we used, that it must have scared him to death, and he dropped me like a hot potato. "It was so unprofessional that I still cannot believe that a doctor would tell me what he did, and then would never return my calls. It seems like 
he should have been man enough to call me and tell me that he did not want to be involved with that kind of treatment. But NO, he said nothing. 
\par So I had to get established with a new doctor. I selected a female doctor of osteopathic. When I saw her the fir
st time, I told her the same thing I had told the first doctor and she agreed to work with me. I had the films with me and she studied them and did a physical exam. She found in the film, that a lymph node was also i}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f38\fs24\insrsid6443811 nvolved. She said I am going to }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f38\fs24\insrsid5134618 measure 
(that lump) in the breast. She did and put the measurement down in my chart. The last time she measured it, she told me it was 6 centimeters in diameter. 
\par Some months later, she recommended that I have a PET scan, which I found out, also included having a 
CAT scan. In the PET scan they inserted an IV into my arm. Away from the skin about 1 or 2 inches, the tube made a Y and then there were 2 tubes away from there. They put a syringe into each tube. One syringe contained radio-active isotopes and the other 
t
ube contained sugar water. They were inserted into the IV simultaneously. I was told that the sugar would go to every cancer cell in my body and they would be able to track it by the isotopes. The report showed that there were no cancer cells anywhere in 
m
y body, except some, still in the original site. But I have had a terrible time getting the measurement of it, as I was told I would be able to get. The radiologist "had to locate my files, and pull the film, and measure it" and he apparently could not fi
nd time to do that. I have called repeatedly. 
\par Finally this evening I received the call I have been waiting for - - - at that time, in September, the tumor measured 1. 3 Hallelujah and Praise be to God!!!
\par Of course I knew that the tumor had shrunk, but noth
ing speaks as loudly as NUMBERS. I consider a reduction from 6 centimeters to 1. 3 is absolutely WONDERFUL!!! That much reduction has happened in 13 months, so I feel like surely that in 6 more months, it will be totally gone. The lymph node is completely
 diminished and cannot be seen in film or physical exam. 
\par Coincidentally, I had decided today, to add vegetable juice to my regimen. I take the FL/cottage cheese for breakfast, the vegetable juice at noon, and eat a small amount in the evening.

\par This morning, March 26, 1999, there is a new development that I feel we should add to this document. On Saturday January 23 I went to a prostate cancer support group meeting for the first time.
\par It was a bad morning to drive and a gentleman came for the first, and perhaps only, time. He took a cancer tape with him. Just after that his wife was found to have a rare, fast growing tumor that was developing in the aftermath of a mastectomy.
\par 
\par The prognosis was very grim and the doctor gave her little hope. It was determined that chemo would be given in an effort to slow down the cancer but the only hope for survival would
 probably have to be stem cell transplants, which in itself is a dangerous procedure. She was very concerned and frightened concerning the future.
\par Having b
ecome aware of the values of flaxseed oil she began using it at six tablespoons a day and had gotten a rebounder and was using that at first, but had to abandon that because it aggravated something in connection with the chemo, as I understand. She told t
he doctor that she was using flaxseed oil. His only comment was that she should go ahead; that it couldn't hurt.
\par After the third treatment, the tumor has disappeared. The doctor told her that he could guarantee that the cancer would return unless she went with further treatment.
\par They are going to do further treatments with a drug that is supposed to strengthen the immune system. She is sure that the flaxseed oil has played the major role in the situation but that won't be recognized.
\par However the only thing that matters is that the crisis appears to be over, the stem cell procedure won't need to be used, she is feeling very good abut it but hardly daring to believe yet that she is facing a normal future.
\par She will be continuing the use of flaxseed oil and depen
ding on a strong immune system to prevent any recurrence. She is very much aware that the meeting that day was more than coincidence. The weather was terrible, her husband almost turned back twice and Mary Anna was very much opposed to my going. She is aw
are that The Lord was watching over her and we believe that also.

\par A few months ago a young woman brought her father in law for a visit. He had been found to have colon cancer and the tumors had practically filled the colon before it was realized.
\par The doctors decided to try a new approach and insert a tube to hold the tumors out of the way and allow normal functions while an experimental chemo was use in an attempt to shrink the tumors.
\par They came on a Saturday and the procedure was scheduled for Monday.
\par Not wishing to die for lack of trying all possibilities this man started using flax oil immediately at four tablespoons a day.
\par He was back in a few weeks for more oil, some for himself and some for some folks he knew, and was happy. He said the t
ube was uncomfortable. He said the tumors were shrinking rapidly and one day he had a big BM and the tube was not there any more. He has been back several times since then.
\par One problem is that he is not telling the doctors what he is doing. If he recovers, as it seems is happening, it will be an interesting result for the new chemo, or will it?
\par The end of this account is not happy. He stayed with the chemo because he didn't want to "make the doctors mad". Finally, one day when he was here he said he just had to get off the chemo because it was killing him and he was losing weight.
\par The doctors OK'd him to quit it and the weight loss stopped. However, a couple of months later he died. The chemo had done too much damage. It is wiser to tell the doctors one is u
sing Flax Oil and if the doctors refuse to treat any longer one may be a lot better off.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\f38\fs24\insrsid5134618

\par HI,
\par Yesterday I had a telephone call that seems to me significant. It is a way that I hear of the "unacceptable anecdotes" that I have mentioned from time to time.
\par The phone call was from a lady who has Lymphocytic Leukemia and she had been using Flaxseed Oil. The doctors are watching her white counts and do not fe
el there is any need for "treatment" at present. She was concerned about a rise in the white count. Earlier the white count had gone down. It seems to be fluctuating.
\par Then the significant part to me.
\par Her husband had cancer in the esophagus. He is a veteran and was being checked through a VA hospital. I do not know the treatment regimen.
\par However, he heard of the use of Flaxseed Oil and began using it. I believe at four tablespoons a day.
\par Now the cancer is gone. He continues to use the Flax Oil. He told the doctor what he is doing. The doctor told him that he didn't know about things like that but whatever he was doing, keep doing it.
\par This was not the major story as far as she was concerned. She only mentioned that as the reason that she had begun using it for her situation.
\par These were just matter of fact statements.
\par 
\par Over the years I have discovered that when one 
gets well or improves someone who knows them and also has cancer does not need clinical double blind studies to get started. I have known of quite a number of folks over the last eight or nine years who have died because they refused to do anything the do
ctors did not tell them to do or who believe that if anything is suggested other than what the doctors recommend it cannot be of any real value.
\par I would think that if doctors were really interested in getting people well there would at least be some that wo
uld be curious enough to seriously double check Dr. Budwig's work with the Flax Oil PLUS the protein which researchers are omitting in their experimental work.

\par In our area about five years ago there lived a man in his forties wh
o had cancer of the esophagus that was so bad that it had grown around his windpipe so tight he was talking with a squeaky voice. He had lung cancer as well and a lung had been removed at Vanderbilt. He had had so much chemo and radiation the doctors did 
not dare give him anymore because it would kill him.
\par He began using flaxseed oil and cottage cheese and it was not many months before to all outward appearance he was cancer free. He was living a normal life. I talked to him different times.
\par He was extremely tight with a dollar and now decided that he was well and didn't need any more flax oil. He quit and in a few months it was again becoming a problem.
\par Mutant cells are always present. If it were possible to "get them all killed" every day there would be more tomorrow. A strong immune system will keep them from getting anywhere. Somehow this may be one of the results of using flaxseed oil/cottage cheese.

\par He wouldn't return to using flaxseed oil and died.

\par He was given chemo and couldn't stand it. He was put on hospice with morphine patches in case the pain got too great. He was 73 and had just about decided to go to the hospital and die.

 began to use 6 tablespoons of flaxseed oil and cottage cheese a day.
\par He said it "kicked in" right away, though usually it does not work quite that quickly.
\par He had an appointment with the Oncologist before long and the doctor took X rays. The caller said he came out of the lab soon with a puzzled look on his face and asked him what, if anything, he had been doing.
\par He told the doctor he had been using flaxseed oil.
\par The doctor said that the tumor he had in his right lung had not changed, but the tumor in his left lung, about which he had not told him, had completely disappeared without a trace.
\par He gave the doctor a tape and told me that the doctor and nurses were making tapes and distributing them.
\par The caller said he was feeling good, continuing on the flaxseed oil and getting along well and seemed quite excited; as I was to hear it.
\par We are praising The Lord for His provision.

\par The doctors found a tumor about the size of a quarter on the lower part of her right lung and immediately urged an operation to remove half of the lung.
\par She was afraid she could not stand the operation and her grandson who knew us well urged her to go on Flax Oil. I talked to her as well.
\par She did but did not use it as she should have. Nevertheless there was no further growth of the tumor and I thought all was well.
\par About two years later I heard that she had died. Her grandson told me that on later checkups 
there was no growth of the cancer but the doctor kept urging an operation. The daughter that lived one door down did not want her to do it but she had five other children and they persuaded her to go along with the doctor's advice.
\par She did not make it off the operating table. The grandson did not feel kindly toward his aunts and uncles but rationalized that it was his Mamaw's time to go.

\par About 6 years ago a friend of ours had a cousin who was a veteran of WW II. He had very serious lung cancer and it had spread to his upper arm.
\par He got started with Flax Oil and it was not many months before we heard he was cancer free in a check up at the VA hospital. He called me and talked about it and was a happy man.
\par About two years later I heard that he 
had passed away. Some folks have the idea that flax oil is like an antibiotic. He got well so he saw no further use for the oil. That is a mistake. One should have at least a maintenance dose of oil each day to keep healthy.

\par The brother in law of Betsy, a member of a local church was 47 years old and incapacitated with lung cancer. This was around 7 years ago as I remember.
\par He ha
d been given up and was doing no standard treatment. He began using 4 tablespoons of Flaxseed Oil a day with cottage cheese and in time [I do not know exactly how long but it was not many months] the only souvenir left was a little scar tissue and he was 
back at work. I never knew his name but did not about him. Betsy is the best friend of a good friend of ours.
\par  
\par ***********************
\par 
\par I visited the church occasionally as the main musician was a fellow teacher and good friend. Kim was also the pastor's niece.
\par The pastor's wife had colon cancer and had part of the colon removed and had been put on heavy chemo. Kim wanted her to switch to flax oil but a daughter was a student nurse, and told her "Momma, do what the doctor tells you". In a while the lady had
 virtually no immune system left and the doctor advised her to stay away from people lest she catch a cold and die and took her off the chemo to see if her body could rebuild. Now she began using Flax Oil. In a short time the white count was going up and 
s
he was able to be out in public again. She had an appointment with the doctor and told him what she was doing. He told her that had not done her any good. It was the chemo that was helping her. She was put back on chemo and in about three months she went 
into a coma and died. The chemo had destroyed her heart and liver.
\par One Sunday night the pastor, John, asked me for a tape. I didn't know he had not had one. A few weeks later I visited again and was talking with John after the service. He told me that he ho
ped I was wrong but that he believed I was right. He said, "They killed my wife". Then I asked him if he had heard about Betsy's brother in law. He said, "I hear he's pretty bad." I said, "He's well." Betsy was still there and John asked her how her broth
er in law was doing. She said, "He's well".
\par John looked at me, and with all the feeling he could put in it, he said, "There's going to be doctors in HELL because of things like this!!"

a checkup 8 weeks later there had been no further growth. The doctor still urged her to get an operation. A subsequent X ray showed no growth but was a little fuzzy as to any reduction. She had an MRI Oct. 19 and a consultation Oct 25 but I haven't heard 
any results.
\par In January 2002 I learned that in early November of 2001 she had had a hip bone "explode" and had been hospitalized for quite a while, I think in late January before she was released. She did not have an opportunity to use the flaxoil/cottage c
heese during that time.

\par 
\par That night the lady called and told me that her husband was a retired college professor, 73, who had an 85% involvement with cancer in his left lung. The decision had been made to remove the lung at the Thompson Cancer center in Knoxville, Tn.
\par 
\par When the attempt was made it was determined that the cancer had spread further and they simply closed up and decided to use radiation and chemo.
\par 
\par The radiation had been done with no apparent results and he and his wife decided that rather than go through the misery of chemo they would just live as long as possible and forget it.
\par 
\par The Oncologist did not argue with that. She suggested that they come to Rutledge and get flax oil and get started with four to eight tablespoons a day with cottage cheese.
\par 
\par They decided on 6 and got two quarts and then got their own after that.
\par 
\par Three months later I was in again and asked if she had seen him again. She had seen him the previous week. The cancer was still there but he was holding his own.
\par 
\par I remembered him about a year and a half later and she said that he had died, but that he did not die of cancer. He was not a very active person and died of a blood clot that moved to his heart.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs36 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs36\insrsid5134618

\par Dear Cliff,
\par I was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer in January 2002. In March 2002 I had surgery and a nodule and the lower right lobe of
 my lung was removed. Five remaining nodules in both lungs. I began Iressa which is a oral cancer drug taken by mouth. At the same time I started taking 4 Tablespoons of
\par flaxseed oil with one half cup of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f38\fs24\insrsid3294334 cottage}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f38\fs24\insrsid5134618  cheese daily. When my cancer was diagnosed I
 was given three months to live. I am now close to my two year anniversary and while I cannot discount the Iressa I take daily, I give most of the credit to the flaxseed oil and cottege cheese. While on a trip to Oregon, I was unable to get lactaid free }
{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f38\fs24\insrsid3294334 cottage}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f38\fs24\insrsid5134618 
 cheese and did not take it for two weeks and experienced severe chest pains. They stopped when I resumed my daily regimen of oil and cheese. I am convinced it is what keeps me feeling wonderful and I do not even know I have lung cancer. Doctors who t
reat me and friends who observe me say they cannot believe that I have lung cancer either.

\par Betsy is a friend of ours, in her 70s I suppose. She has multiple myeloma, a very deadly kind of bone cancer, and is being treated by the same oncologist I go to. 
\par We saw Betsy a couple weeks ago. She's bright eyed and bushy tailed. . . her old self. She mentioned that Dr. ----- had recently told her she was his "miracle patient". 
\par This spring I had heard about Betsy's situation. It was greatly different from what it is today. She was extremely sick and unable to eat.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f38\fs24\insrsid1734096  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0

thought she was dying. He may have been right. 
\par It had taken a long time for her doctors to diagnose an obviously deteriorating health condition as multiple myeloma, so that it was quite an advanced case before she was referred to Dr. -------as I understand it. 
\par I believe she had recently been started on chemotherapy by Dr. -------- a little before I learned what was happening. But no matte how good his treatment might have been, if she couldn't eat she wasn't going to get better. 
\par I went down to --------- and bought a pint of Barlean's lignan rich flaxseed oil, some low-fat cottage cheese, a pineapple and some honey,}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f38\fs24\insrsid1734096  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f38\fs24\insrsid5134618 and took it over to Don.

\par Later still, I heard that Betsy likes tuna fish in her flaxseed oil and cottage cheese smoothies, instead of the pineapple. You can use anything in the smoothies to make them taste good to you. 
\par In the meantime, Don had ordered some of the oil direct from Barlean's. 
\par If you're a cancer patient it's sold to you at wholesale and costs about half as much as at-------------or other health food stores, even with the shipping cost. 
\par It wasn't too much longer before Betsy was able to get up and be in a wheelchair. Soon she was able to stand and get around a little with a walker. 
\par A month or so ago she went in some cancer event that involved a 3-mile walk. She had intended only to do the first mile but ended up doin}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f38\fs24\insrsid3294334 g}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Betsy is an avid gar
dener and has one of the city plots. She had been able to get the garden planted somehow, with help from Don, and has been delivering great quantities of produce all summer. Every now and then Don brings some by for us. He thinks I saved Betsy's life.

ing kind of bone cancer because of the combined benefits of the flaxseed oil and chemotherapy?
\par 
\par My friend----------
\par 
\par There is controversy here. I see this as an example of the fact that the flaxseed oil will be of real benefit even though chemo is being used. 
\par I personally do not know of many, if any, situations where the continuous use of chemo has resulted in real recovery. 
\par Chemo does kill cancer cells, maybe 95 to 98% of them, but does not kill all of them. 
\par The patient is now in remission but the resistant cells continue to survive and increase. As the "treatment" is continued, the cancer cells are not affected, but the good cells of the body and the immune system, heart, liver, etc. are contuing
 to be destroyed. 
\par When the patient is aware that the cancer has "returned" a new chemo must be tried because the old one is no longer effective.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f38\fs24\insrsid1734096  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f38\fs24\insrsid5134618 
The cycle is again followed and the patient is again in "remission".}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f38\fs24\insrsid1734096  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f38\fs24\insrsid5134618 The word "remission" is used because ther
e is no expectation of a cure. 
\par With each new cycle of chemo the patient is increasingly weaker and less able to fight the invader and death will occur. 
\par The flaxseed oil, with the Omega 3, may be a major help but cannot do the whole job against the destruction of the chemo. 
\par I do not know the complete details, but I understand that the chemo was continued and eventually Betsy passed away. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid5134618

\par I did not hear anything more for over a year. Then I heard he was back in the hospital and the doctors were giving him a drug that they thought might add a year to his life. 
\par A short while later I heard that he had died. The person who told me that told me that he had quit taking the oil. One cannot do that. This is a lifetime proposition. The oil works in some way to enable the body to defeat the can
cer and if it is stopped the conditions that allowed the cancer to develop in the first place will develop again. This is not something like taking an antibiotic for a sore throat and when the throat is well stop the antibiotic.

\par ...a letter I received today (11 Dec 2004). It is a little long but worth reading. This man has kept a diary of what has happened. 
\par Below is a summary.
\par Cliff 
\par *************
\par I'm writing to thank you for the wonderful information that you were able to give. When I was diagnosed with Prostate Cancer I was devastated. 
\par I was having my annual physical, and my PSA was found to be 7.5.My doctor set up a biopsy by a Uro
logist. Three out of 6 samples were cancers. The Dr. advised that he operate immediately. I asked him a lot of questions and he told me that I could think about what wanted to do.
\par I did some research, read some books, leaflets and different articles. I found out that many of these operations left the patient sexually inactive. 
\par I received much advice from my family, friends and was very unwilling to have the operation. I decided that if I had an operation I still might not survive so I did nothing at all!
\par A
 few weeks had gone by when I received a package in the mail. A friend of mine had known of Cliff and his condition and he sent me a copy of his tape. He told me to listen to it and then to call him. I listened and I called him. We talked for a time and h
e suggested we call Cliff and talk 3 way.
\par Cliff told me his experience, and after many questions this certainly sounded like the way I would go. My family and I decided that we would try this remedy to see what if anything would happen. 
\par Well, I was diagnosed with cancer Jan 12, 2002}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f38\fs24\lang2057\langfe1031\langnp2057\insrsid10448313  and by Feb}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f38\fs24\lang2057\langfe1031\langnp2057\insrsid5134618\charrsid5388876  1st 2002 had begun my cure. I took 3 tablespoons of Flaxseed Oil with 1/2 cup of cottage cheese every day for 3 months and then had a PSA done.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0

eded to be kept.
\par I made an appoint for a PSA and on 3/29/02 I got the result. It was 5.8. While I was buying my Flaxseed oil the sales lady told me that I should buy this new capsule, Prostate 5 LX, 3 months worth for $55.00.
\par After taking it for about 2 weeks I started feeling bad so I stopped taking it. I took the rest of the bottle back and found out that it was to kill the cancer cells. 
\par The next PSA went back up to 7.5. When I bought the capsules I thought they were to cure me, but this wasn't what happened. I knew that Flaxoil healed the cancer cells so he oil is all that I needed. I now the saying, if its working why add anything.

\par On 10/26/02 Another test showed the PSA had dropped from 7.5 to 5.2. It has continued to go down 4.1 then 3.5 etc. Through this whole time I could describe my body feelings as good and bad. I would feel good for awhile and then but but now I feel Great!

\par On 11/10/04 I changed to a new Doctor, one that I had used before but because of Insurance had to leave her and accept another that really only knew me because he had my personal physical folder. Most Doctors only know you by what}{\rtlch\fcs1

\par One time my nurse asked me if I had ever been operated on. I told her no. She told me that she didn't know of anyone that hadn't been operated on that had had their PSA go down!
\par This doctor was concerned about me having cancer and had a PSA that was 5.4 so she sent me to the hospital to have pictures made of my whole body, upper, stomach and Pelvis and the results came back all negative; no detectable cancer.
\par Here is the answer, Flaxseed Oil, 3 tablespoons in 1/2 cup of cottage cheese everyday without fail. I missed it a couple of times but always took it by
 the next day. When I am away from home I always carry my Flax Oil with me in a cooler so I would always have it.
\par My phone number is 706 625 2082. Anyone that needs more info can call me.

\par My brother had not had a physi
cal in years and finally did. He had a PSA of 785. Cancer had spread through the spinal column into his skull. It was in the bladder and one kidney. He was a member of an HMO and they put him on Stilbesterol. He had been unable to eat for six weeks and lo
s
t 50 pounds and suddenly was able to eat again. He also began taking Flaxseed oil and cottage cheese. In a few weeks he had gained 40 pounds, was working again and had a PSA of 8. The Prostate had gone from the size of a baseball to normal size. The bone

It is my intention to give a very short summary of the situations involving PCa and the use of flaxseed oil that I remember, other than my own situation. I do not know many details in many of these situations; only the results. Nevertheless, one thing tha
t is evident is that the use of the flaxseed oil did not cause the PCa to grow faster than normal.
\par In the summer of 1992 I began to write a long letter to a friend and decided to talk it into a tape as I hate writing long letters. It wasn't easier but it was accomplished. I made a copy in case anyone else}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0

 to be only a powerful weapon that is being ignored.
\par Had I known at the time that it was believed in some medical circles to be dangerous I would not have felt as I did. Thank God I did not know. I would have not used it and been long dead and there would 
be no lists. We have not seen any of the results against which we have been warned. Quite the contrary.)

About six years ago a man I knew slightly, then 75 years old, was found to have a PSA of 73. He had learned of the use of Flaxseed oil and for three months ate nothin
g but uncooked fruits and vegetables and flaxseed oil and cottage cheese. In that three months his PSA dropped to 13; a 60 point drop in 90 days. It would seem that it may be the combined effect of the flaxseed oil and cottage cheese and the enzymes in th
e fresh fruits and vegetables.

Over four years ago I visited a doctor to talk hormone replacement therapy, as I thought I might be too low on testosterone. He was a GP specializing in nutritional therapies. He was much interested in my situation and wanted a tape. Two days lat
er he called and wanted a tape sent to a patient of his who had ovarian cancer. The next time I heard from him was a few weeks ago. He had heard that my PSA had risen somewhat and asked how I was. It seems that he had had a PSA that was 0.2. The next time
 
it was checked it was 380, the prostate was greatly enlarged and there was extensive bone involvement. He is in his early seventies. He had gone on hormone blockade and flaxseed oil and cottage cheese. Now the PSA is 5, the prostate gland is normal and th
e bone involvement is still there but greatly improved. Subsequently he left the flax Oil and stayed with standard treatment. He died Dec. 4, 2000.

Five years ago a friend asked us to send a tape to Chester Sexton, a barber in Onieda, T
N. He had Advanced PCa. He was around 70. He wanted to keep barbering as long as possible. I do not know what treatment he had had up to that time. I asked the friend about six months later and asked them how Chester was getting along and she said that he
 was doing very well.
\par Two years ago last Christmas Chester called and said that he had gotten the tape and felt he had to get some of that. He started using six tablespoons per day. He said that he got over his cancer. His best friend likewise got over PCa 
and his girl friend got over diabetes. Then some of his customers wanted tapes so he made them. Some wanted tapes for friends. He said that some listened and used the oil. He said that some didn't use it. He said "They died".
\par Very recently a lady from Onieda got in touch with us. Her husband had just found out he had PCa. Chester is selling oil from a freezer in his barber shop at cost as a service.
\par This lady had worked for Chester and his wife in a store as a teenager. She is getting oil from Chester and filled me in on his present condition.

\par \'94In one of my interviews with Dr. Budwig I was introduced to Siegfried Ernst, M.D.. He is a rare and dedicated man who counts among his personal friends the current Pope as well as many other dignitaries.
\par Seventeen years ago Dr. Ernst had developed cancer f
or which he had major surgery requiring removal of his stomach. Two years later he had a recurrence of the cancer and was offered chemotherapy as the only available remedy. There was little hope for survival as virtually all individuals with recurrence of
 this type of cancer rarely last a year.

\par He turned to Dr. Budwig an
d her formula for help. He religiously followed Dr. Budwig's formula and fifteen years later has not had any recurrence of cancer. As a matter of fact he seemed to me to be in perfect health and is tireless for a man in his late seventies.
\par Maria W. tells h
er story in her own words: "I was told by the most expert of doctors that I would have to be operated on to cut out the cancerous tumor that was causing a swelling under my eye. They explained that the size of the tumor was much greater inside and that th
e
re was very serious bone involvement. The malignancy was too far advanced to respond to radiation treatment. The doctors planned to remove considerable facial tissue and bone. I was afraid for my life, but being a young woman, couldn't bear the thought of
 such disfigurement.
\par When I heard about Dr. Budwig's natural formula, I was skeptical but desperate for help. After four months on this regimen, the swelling under my left eye completely disappeared. The doctors at the University hospital gave me many exhau
sting tests. One told me, 'If I didn't have your previous x-rays and medical history in front of me, I wouldn't believe that you ever had cancer. There is hardly any indication of a tumor remaining.' I never thought using Dr, Budwig's formula would be so 
successful. My whole family and I are very grateful.\rquote 
\par An examination of Sandy A. revealed arachnoidal bleeding due to an inoperable brain tumor. The doctors informed Sandy that he was beyond medical help. At his expressed wish, Sandy was discharged from the hospital and sent home to die in peace.
\par A friend brought Dr. Budwig\rquote s formula to Sandy\rquote s attention. Sandy writes. \lquote Since I went on the Budwig regimen, the paralysis is of my eyes, arms, and legs has receded daily. After only a short period of time, I was 
able to urinate normally. My health improved so rapidly that I was soon able to return to my work part-time. Shortly after that, I was again examined at the Research Center and my reflexes were completely normal. The Budwig diet saved my life! Ten years l
ater, I was given a thorough examination at the Center as a follow-up. My incredible recovery has been written up In many medical journals and I have become what they call a 'text-book case,' and all because of Dr. Johanna Budwig's simple diet.\rquote 

\par Seven years ago Timmy G. was diagnosed as having Hodgkin}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f38\fs24\cf1\lang2057\langfe1031\langnp2057\insrsid10448313 \rquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0

s disease. The child was operated on and underwent 24 radiation treatments, plus additional experimental therapies that the experts hoped would be of some small help. When Timmy failed to respond favorably to t
hese heroic measures, he was discharged as incurable, and given six months to live and sent home to die.
\par The desperate parents contacted specialists all over the world. A famous newspaper took up Timmy's cause and ran editorials pleading for someone to com
e forth who could offer hope for the life of a child. All the specialists who replied confirmed the cruel prognosis: There was no hope or help for Timmy. At this dark hour the miracle the family had prayed for happened! Timmy's mother told her story to th
e press:
\par \lquote A friend sent me a printed piece about one of Dr. Budwig's speeches. This material gave us hope and I contacted Dr. Budwig.
\par In just five days, (on the Budwig regimen) Timmy's breathing became normal for the first time in almost two years. From thi
s day on, Timmy began to feel good again. He went back to school, started swimming and by winter he was doing craft work. Everyone who knows him says how well he looks.\rquote 
 At age 18 Timmy is showing great promise in his university work. He knows he owes his life to Dr. Budwig and thanks her daily in his prayers.\'94

\par Tom's three month MRI looked good, his brain was clean and the hole where they remo
ved the tumor was empty except for a tiny line around a portion of the inside of the hole. The doctor said that it could be scar tissue, a benign bit of tumor or a regrowth of the Glioblastoma. At the six month MRI his brain was completely clean. There wa
s no cancer at all. The doctor said that it was a miracle. In 14 years of practice he had not seen anything like it. This is what we did:
\par Take 1/4 cup Low Fat Cottage Cheese and mix it with 1 tablespoon Flaxseed oil and eat it twice a day.
\par Take Three 750 mg Shark Cartilage capsules three times a day
\par Take a Borage Oil and CoQ10 supplement
\par Drink plenty of water
\par Try to get light exercise, walking is best
\par Get some sunlight
\par For the first three months I also rubbed Frankincense on his head because it is supposed to have anti-tumor properties.
\par 
\par I searched on the Internet to see if there were other people having success with the flaxseed oil and cottage cheese. Go to www.beckwithfamily.com for some good testimonies and links. I found other sites like www.curezone.com
 where people were having success beating their cancer through holistic means. Another good sight is www.shirleys-wellness-cafe.com After doing more research and talking to more people we added some things to our regimen after the first three-month MRI.

\par 
\par Graviola 5 drops 3 times a day
\par The AIM Garden Trio (BarleyLife, Carrots, Beets)
\par 
\par He started using an extract of a Brazilian fruit plant called Graviola (5 drops three times a day). We also added the AIM Garden Trio twice a day to build up Tom's health. Our whole family tries to take at least one AIM Garden Trio a day now.
\par 
\par Tom did not go vegetarian, but we did cut back on meat and sugar. We follow the biblical eating laws and do not eat any pork or unclean fish. It makes it harder 
for your body to fight cancer if you put unclean and artificial things into it. We think artificial sweetener caused Tom's cancer. He used to drink at least 2 liters a day of diet soda. Go to www.dorway.com for more info.

\par March 27, 2004 
\par Our background history: Both of my husband's (I call him Huck) parents died of cancer. His mother had breast cancer and his Dad had brain cancer. 
\par One of them had radiation treatments and the other had chemo. We saw their quality of life go}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f38\fs24\lang2057\langfe1031\cgrid0\langnp2057\insrsid10448313  down hill from then on, for ab}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f38\fs24\lang2057\langfe1031\cgrid0\langnp2057\insrsid5134618\charrsid5388876 out a year and they died. 
\par We said "if we ever get cancer, we are not going to take either one of those treatments." Maybe the treatments have improved over 
the years, but my mind has not changed. I refuse to let anything into my body that will harm it. I will only take something that will do something to build my body up and strengthen my immune system. 
\par Then in 1994 Huck was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 
and given possibly 3 months to live. We were fortunate to have an honest doctor who told us that it would serve no purpose for him to take radiation or chemo, because they cannot do any good, when cancer is in the pancreas. It was not hard to convince him
, as that was already our decision, from years back. 
\par We treated him from home, with alternative methods (before that time we knew nothing of any such treatments). We tried everything we heard of or could read about. Basically it was ALL DIETARY. We worked 
with a Doctor of Nutrition, who practices in Illinois. One thing he told us was to go to a health food store and buy Flax Seed Oil, that was being stored in a}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0

mount 3 times a day. We had never heard of Flax Seed Oil, but we did as he said. Plus we did so many other things, including Huck taking many vitamins and going on a very restricted diet of only vegetables, beans, and grains. Within 6 months Huck had reco
v
ered from that "very large tumor". We asked the same surgeon to take a CAT scan and tell us what it looked like. His report? : He was astounded when he told us that there was no sign of cancer, that everything looked completely normal. Huck has remained f
ree of cancer ever since then - 1994. 
\par Then on October 8, 2002 I was awakened with serious pain in one breast. My hand went to that area and felt a large protrusion. I called, that day,}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f38\fs24\lang2057\langfe1031\cgrid0\langnp2057\insrsid1734096  }{

iagnosed with Lobular Infiltrating Carcinoma. I went that very day to the health food store and bought Flax Seed Oil and to the grocery for low fat cottage cheese. I have not missed a day of eating it since then. And I have learned a whole lot more about 
t
hat cancer protocol, discovered by Dr. Johanna Budwig in the 1950s. The chemical composition of the mixture gives you Omega III, which almost everyone is deficient of. By the end of two weeks, after I had begun taking this mixture, my pain subsided. I hav
e had some pains VERY occasionally since then, but nothing lasting or severe. My energy has remained high and I have continued with my previous life style. 
\par I have not had one day of any kind of ill effects, or of even feeling tired.

Last year when I was thinking of writing an article on the benefits of flax oil and cottage che
ese for treating cancer, I called Dr. Budwig in Germany and spoke with her directly. She was reluctant to give specifics, since she was involved with an upcoming court case being brought against her by what she described as the German equivalent of Kennet
h Starr. (She said at that time, that she's been taken to court before, but has always prevailed, and that she could do it again.)\line 
She said that the medical establishment is against her because she refuses to combine her treatment with chemo and/or other st
andard treatments that can break down the immune system. It should be noted that Dr. Budwig has been nominated not once, but seven times, for the Nobel Prize for her research. She didn't want me to write an article in layman's terms about her work, becaus
e
 she felt it would diminish its importance. She did tell me that she has successfully treated cancer patients whose doctors had given them only weeks or days to live, and said that at that time she was still treating patients who come to her from all over
 
the world. She didn't mention specific types of cancer. But said she has had a success rate approaching 98%. I asked her to translate that into an actual figure, and she said the number of patients she's successfully treated is approximately 1000. She als
o said that a hospital in Spain is using her methods, and has experienced a similar rate of success. She urged me to fly to Germany to see her work for myself.\line 
During the time when I was gathering information for my proposed article, I was informed that the market was already flooded with research articles showing that flax oil (while promising) has not been shown to be a cure for cancer.\line 
I read two of these articles at that time (though I can't remember what magazines they were in). Each said that flax oil 
had helped, but not cured or even significantly reduced the cancer it was being used to treat. The key factor that was missing in this research was the need for a sulfur based protein combined with the Omega 3 found in the flax oil. I tried to convince se
veral editors that my proposed article differed from the others in that it tells of Dr. Budwig's research and the need for the protein found in quark or cottage cheese. But the editors weren't interested.\line 
I have personally spoken by phone to six of the peop
le Cliff tells about on his tape. They basically told me the same thing they told him. Of the 7 people I've convinced to try the flax oil and cottage cheese for their cancer (prostate, stomach, bone, and/or lymphoma), here are the results to date:\line 
Two star
ted taking it and were beginning to see results. One of these had a PSA of 7, and the flax oil and cottage cheese brought it down to point five. The other had bone cancer. The prostate cancer patient's doctor told him nothing could work that fast. He said
 
the flax oil must be masking the symptoms, and told him to stop taking it . He did, and his PSA went back up. The doctor removed his prostate and performed an angioplasty. The bone cancer patient's doctor told her only chance of survival was a massive dos
e of chemo. She took it, and it killed her within 24 hours.\line A third started, then quit, then started again, then quit again without even giving it a chance. She is currently in the hospital, being given a month to live.\line 
A former prostate cancer sufferer (nu
mber 4) who had his prostate removed before hearing about Flax Oil and Cottage Cheese now has a cancerous tumor on his spine. He started taking 6 T of oil with 1 1/4 c of cottage cheese a day. After one month, his PSA had dropped from the high 30's to two
 point five. He is ecstatic, and looking forward to his next bone scan.\line A friend's grandmother (number 5), who's been taking it for about a month, hasn't yet let me know whether she's seeing any results.\line The remaining two are now cancer free.

(In the future, if anyone reading this can furnish us with any result of the use of flax oil with our pet, I will add it to this account for the benefit of future contacts. Of course, I am now seventy seven, so how many years I have is uncertain, though I
 
do not see any immediate problems. The flax oil has arrested the problem long ago, but it had come back a little because I had not known that Dr. Budwig recommended one tablespoon a day per hundred lb. Body weight and not just a tablespoon a day. We've in
creased and seem on the right road again. Whether man or pet, this must be kept up for life to keep bodies able to handle cancer cells.)
\par 
\par The first thought of pet application came when a man told me about his dog. He was getting along in dog years and had developed cancer. His eyes were dull and he was so weak that he couldn't lift his leg. This man told me that he mixed up a couple of tabl
espoons with some cottage cheese a couple of times a day and the dog wolfed it down. He said it wasn't long before the dog's eyes were bright, his coat was shiny and he was running all over the place.
\par 
\par The second that I knew of was a similar situation with a dog that was owned by my cousin's daughter. In both cases the dogs lived out a normal doggy life.
\par 
\par Then a few years ago I received, in a Christmas card, an item cut out of a paper in Maine. My friend told me that I would enjoy it. It was a question to th
e veterinary column. The question was how to prevent his pet squirrel from losing its hair. The answer was to feed it flaxseed oil. It would build up its immune system and it wouldn't lose its hair.
\par 
\par A few years ago a young kitty cat wandered in, very maln
ourished, and had very little hair. I thought of the article, and put out cottage cheese with around a teaspoon of flaxseed in it. She had that every day along with regular cat food. It wasn't but a short time that she developed a shiny coat, and is today
 a beautiful cat. After that she wouldn't eat it anymore. Maybe animals have an instinct about things like that.
\par 
\par One lady I know had a large dog that had developed cancer that was fairly advanced. The folks tried everything to get it to eat food with flax oil in it, and it just wouldn't. It did die.
\par 
\par One man wrote to me from Wisconsin and told me about their dog. I quote from his letter as follows, "Results! Our dog, Penny, was to have died two and a half years ago from several cancerous tumors. We changed 
her diet, gave her many nutritious supplements and herbs. She survived..but..was still in pain and slept most of the day away. So, she is a member of the family too, so we gave her one Tablespoon of the Flax Oil daily [she is a small dog of about 35 pound
s]. Now she goes for a four mile morning walk with Ina and seems to be better than before and many of the tumors have receded."
\par 
\par I know of other situations in general, but not in specific detail. I do know that our local vet is impressed enough with it that she is recommending flax oil when people bring in pets with cancer.
\par 
\par One of our correspondents, Ron Conley of Texas, has a Siberian Huskey, Natasha, that had been in serious trouble with cancer. He has a detailed account of what was done to treat her over
 four months time. I believe the vet had believed that she could not live more than 30 to 60 days. The treatments involved a lot of things with flaxseed oil a major support. The dog is doing very well today, and his web page includes references to several
 different pet situations. For information, check his web site: http://home.earthlink.net/~texas2step/cancerfightnewsletter.html#Month14/
\par It is an inspiring story.
\par 
\par Question:
\par Our 9 month old puppy was diagnosed with a mast cell tumor at 6 months - we have h
ad her on 1 cup of kefir with 6 T of flax oil daily for the past two months. Last week we noticed another bump on her leg (about an inch from the original tumor, which was surgically removed) & have a feeling that it's another tumor. Any suggestions? I'm 
beginning to wonder if Kefir wasn't the appropriate sulphur protein to mix with the flax oil, but I've read that it's ok. Should I up the dosage? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated
\par 
\par Answer:
\par We have an old dog, with arthritis, etc. that go with old
 age, and so I have been mixing my FO/CC every morning and giving her 2 Tablespoons of it (she is a very small terrier). I do mix the Flaxseed oil with low fat cottage cheese and Flax seeds. The first time I offered it to her, she turned up her nose and w
alked away. I thought "Little l}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f38\fs24\insrsid6443811 ady, you ARE going to eat that.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af38\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f38\fs24\insrsid5134618 
" So the next morning I prepared it as usual and spoon fed it to her. She did not resist, but swallowed it right down. After 3 days of spoon feeding, I just put it on a saucer and held the saucer
 down to her, but kept holding it (I thought maybe that would be to her about the same as me spoon feeding her). She lapped the saucer clean. The next day I sat the saucer down on the floor right beside me and she ate it all. 
\par Now, when I begin to make my 
mixture every morning, as soon as she hears the blender running, she comes running from wherever she was, and stands very close to me, licking her lips (literally) and quivering with excitement. Ever since then she has eaten it faithfully and eagerly. 

\par I give it to her before I add fruit, as she does not seem to like the fruit. The mixture I give her 2 Tablespoons of, consists of:
\par 2 or 3 Tablespoons of skim milk
\par 3 Tablespoons of Flaxseed oil
\par 2 Tablespoons of Flax seeds
\par Blend slightly. 
\par Then I add 1/2 cup low fat cottage cheese, a little bit at a time, blending after each addition. 
\par Next I add 1 Tablespoon of raw honey. 
\par I give her 2 Tablespoons of this mixture. 
\par Then I add 1/2 cup 100% grape juice. 
\par I drink this with as much relish as my little dog shows. 
\par She shows no signs of cancer, but I do have diagnosed breast cancer, which became apparent on Oct. 8, 2002. I began the FO/CC the same day. My tumor has shrunk dramatically (within days I should know the exact measurement of it - - from the radiologist, w
h
o has said he will look up my file and measure it). But I know this much, at the beginning I also had a lymph node that was involved - - - (it is completely reduced now, and my doctor can no longer find it. ) The entire tumor has shrunk dramatically. I ha
d entire body scans recently and they show that I have no cancer cells in my body, except the original ones in the breast. I plan to continue eating my FO/CC until it is all gone. I expect that it will be in another year. 
\par If I were you, I would make this mixture that I have written about and give it to your little dog. I believe that it would cure her of cancer, if you are faithful in giving it to her, and do not give up, but continue it indefinitely. 
\par I hope you can do this. I understand how much you love your dog - - - just as I love mine. 
\par My sympathy and understanding goes out to you. And please keep us updated on how your little dog does. 
\par I don't know what Kefir is, but I know that Dr. Budwig said to use low fat cottage cheese, and that is THE ONLY THING that I would mix the oil with.

\par Hi Cliff, Thank you for the info on the lady from Missouri. It\lquote s so wonderful to know that I can help other people, like you and others have helped me. Your testimonials saved Shilo's life. Shilo is doing great. Shilo and Woodson \{My other dog\}
 are both on Flax oil and cottage cheese and vitamins. Their energy level is so much better and Shilo seems even more healthier than even before he was sick. Everybody who has seen Shilo can't believe how good he looks and how his fur coat is so shi}{

Maybe that will floor them. Have any other suggestions? Ron Conley is working on Shilo's story for an upcoming news letter. It should be pretty cool. I have to tell you something, you should get a kick out of this. Shilo, Woodson and myself take t

\par Diamond featured in the Whole Dog Journal
\par In the August 2000 issue of Whole Dog Journal, there is a great article written by Barb Hamlin, a dog owner from Michigan. Hamlin tells the story of her German Shepherd's recovery from soft tissue cancer - which di
d NOT involve chemotherapy or radiation. Instead, Hamlin employed a nutritional approach she found on the internet. . . . This approach was developed by a German scientist, Dr. Joanna Budwig, who has written several books about her successes in treating a
ll sorts of cancers with a supplement made of cottage cheese and flax oil. Dr. Budwig's most recent book is 'Flax Oil As A True Aid Against Arthritis, Heart Disease, Cancer, and Other Diseases'.
\par Hamlin gave her dog 1/4 cup of low fat cottage cheese and 1 1/
2 tablespoons of Barlean's Organic Flax Seed Oil two times a day, as well as supplements such as vitamin C, vitamin E, juiced vegetables, and digestive enzymes. She also fasted her dog once a week, and withheld any vaccinations or chemical flea or tick tr
eatments. Within three months, the tumor had Completely disappeared.
\par Hamlin describes her protocol thoroughly in the WDJ article, which is available for purchase from the publisher, Belvoir Publications, by calling 800-424-7887 or writing to customer_servic
e@b.... As of October 2000 Barb reports that Diamond is doing great!
